QA Model Monitoring acts as one of the primary ways to mitigate Model Risk by highlighting areas of sub-optimal performance and by proposing effective remediation plan for models in use by business. Model Risk is the potential of adverse consequences (e.g. financial loss, reputational impact, regulatory censure etc.) due to decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. This can arise from fundamental model weaknesses leading to inaccurate outputs, errors in implementation, or incorrect/inappropriate use. Monitoring team periodically evaluates model performance. Monitoring findings help business decide upon the further uses of the model to continue, adjust, or discontinue and rebuild the model."
